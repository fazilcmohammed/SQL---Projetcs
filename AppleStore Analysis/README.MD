# Business Problem
The ever-changing mobile landscape is a challenging space to navigate. . The percentage of mobile over desktop is only increasing. Android holds about 53.2% of the smartphone market, while iOS is 43%. To get more people to download the app, they need to make sure they can easily find the app. Mobile app analytics is a great way to understand the existing strategy to drive growth and retention of future user.
Here, I have a huge collection of data from app store of Apple and going to analyse the data effectively and extract meaningfull insights like the overview of user ratings for each application, apps per genre, user ratings for paid and free application and other key business metrics. Visualisations must also be created to identify trends and insights best and least genres application, the correlation between the app description and user rating, etc.  The end goal is to equip the business with data-driven insights that inform strategic decisions to improve operations and profitability.
