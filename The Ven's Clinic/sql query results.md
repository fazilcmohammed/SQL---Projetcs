__Questions Answered from the Dataset__

__1) What are the Key Performance Indicators obtained from the Dataset?__

+ __Total Pets Treated:__

      SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT PetID) FROM procedureshistory;
![kpi 1](https://github.com/fazilcmohammed/SQL---Projetcs/assets/140707546/a2672922-670c-43b6-9568-5a11150dc188)

This metric provides a clear measure of the treatment taken  by the pets. It indicates the total count of pets treated from Vet's

![kpi 2](https://github.com/fazilcmohammed/SQL---Projetcs/assets/140707546/8a906372-1bed-4639-8e6d-5fdfef485c48)

Total revenue is the overall financial performance of the clinic. It indicates the total amount of money generated from treatment over a specific period, reflecting the revenue potential of the clinic.

+ __No. of Procedure Types:__

      SELECT DISTINCT proceduretype FROM procedures;
![kpi 3](https://github.com/fazilcmohammed/SQL---Projetcs/assets/140707546/a52aad58-1375-444a-bb93-7079919f69ec)

This will show how much kinds of services are available in the clinic.

+ __Extracting information on pets names and owner names side-by-side:__
  
      SELECT p.Name pet_name, CONCAT(o.Name, ' ', o.Surname) owner_name
      FROM pets p
      JOIN owners o ON p.ownerid = o.ownerid
      ORDER BY pet_name;
![4  pet owner name](https://github.com/fazilcmohammed/SQL---Projetcs/assets/140707546/045f0883-7d26-4c47-a253-6b1b0a3301d5)

This is the list of pets and their owners name asked by the clinic executives.

+ __Find out which pets from this clinic had procedures performed:__

      SELECT ph.PetID pet_id, p.Name pet_name, p.Kind pet_kind
      FROM procedureshistory ph
      JOIN pets p ON ph.PetID = p.PetID;

This query will give the name and kind of pets that treated from the clinic with the kind of treatment.

+ __Match up all procedures performed to their descriptions:__

      SELECT ph.PetID pet_id, p.Name pet_name, p.Kind pet_kind, ph.ProcedureType procedure_type, pd.description, ph.Date
      FROM procedureshistory ph
      JOIN pets p ON ph.PetID = p.PetID
      JOIN proceduresdetails pd ON ph.ProcedureSubCode = pd.ProcedureSubCode

Executives want to see the procedures and details of the procedure for the treatements taken by the pets. And it shows the name, kind of pet, procedure type and its description, and date of treatment taken.

+ __Extract a table of individual costs (procedure prices) incurred by owners of pets from the clinic in question (this table should have owner and procedure price side -by-side):__

      SELECT op.pet_id pet_id, op.owner_name, SUM(p.price) price
      FROM ownerpet op
      JOIN procedures p ON op.pet_id = p.pet_id
      GROUP BY op.pet_id, op.owner_name

This table will show the expenditure of owners for each treatment. Owner name and price are included in this table.

+ __Pets Treated:__

      SELECT  pet_kind, COUNT(p.pet_id) count
      FROM ownerpet op
      JOIN procedures p ON op.pet_id = p.pet_id
      GROUP BY pet_kind

+ __Revenue per month:__

      SELECT MONTH(date) month, SUM(price) revenue
      FROM procedures
      GROUP BY MONTH(date)
      ORDER BY month
![9](https://github.com/fazilcmohammed/SQL---Projetcs/assets/140707546/0862289d-bdb5-4a2f-9161-78ba9237f331)

Revenue per month is the income generated by clinic in each month.

+ __Percentage of revenue per procedure type:__

      SELECT proceduretype, CAST(SUM(price) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) as total_revenue,
      CAST(SUM(price) * 100 / (SELECT SUM(price) from procedures) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS PCT
      FROM procedures
      GROUP BY proceduretype

The distribution of revenue across different procedure type helps in understanding the popularity of each category and its contribution to overall sales.
